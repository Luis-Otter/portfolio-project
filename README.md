# Mental Health Awareness

## Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide basic information pertinent to mental health. It aims to raise awareness of both common mental health issues, the signs to look for, and some guidance on how to cope with and manage things like stress.

Users should find this an easy to navigate tool for learning the basic infomation quickly, and being a good source of coping strategies/techniques.

### Target Audience
The target audience will primarily be students, teenagers, and parents who are in need of information, guidance, and/or strategies for spotting and/or coping with mental health issues.

These users will gain the most value as they will be able to access the most relevant information quickly, and easily find information to help guide them as to what they could try next.

## Design Decisions

To start this section I will breakdown (from the must-have user stories) the most important elements for the webpage. This will then be used as the basis for the design of the site, and can be built upon once the MVP (minimum viable product is finished).

- Clear headings and subheadings
- Category oriented Navigation menu
- Five coping strategies
  - with icons
- list of mental health awareness signs to watch for (focus on teens/students)

### Wireframes

Based on the breakdown above, a linear "narrative" structure would be best; lead each individual through the page from start to finish in a logical sequence. The begining will introduce the subject, then I can have a section about what to look for, followed by the coping strategies, and then I could have a section on where to get help. This would cater to most of the must-have user story elements and produce a MVP that can be improved further if there is time.

The site is structured in this way as it allows to most important information to appear at the top. That is to say, the logical way of providing this information is to give the coping strategies after the symptoms (as someone might see the symptoms, decide they haven't seen any, and then leave the page; such a person will not be interested in the strategies or resources). Thus the most important information is placed closest to the top.

My initial designs for the mobile (small devices) look like this...

<img src="README+/images/small-device-example.png" width=350>

The full page was visualised as this...


<img src="README+/images/small-device-page-pt2.png" width=350>
<img src="README+/images/small-device-page-pt3.png" width=350>

The list of symptoms to watch for may also be redesigned depending on the content, and the general aesthetic of the site. It is currently planned as...

Left side is initial plan, right is alternative:

<img src="README+/images/list-of-symptoms-1.png" width=350><img src="README+/images/list-of-symptoms-2.png" width=350>




### Accessibility Considerations
There are a fair few considerations that have been made in terms of the accessibilty of the site. All images/icons will be given alt text so that screen readers can describe them. Additionaly, the contrast of the colours used will ensure that text can always be read easily and the font will also be selected based on its legibility.

#### fonts

I want the fonts to be modern, clean, and readable. For this reason I have decided upon two fonts:

Lato: [Link to Google fonts Lato page](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato)
![screenshot of Lato font example from google fonts](README+/images/Lato-font-screenshot.png)

The Lato font will be the primary font used on the website; it has a modern design, is easily readable, and is used a lot on the web. 
  - Headers: will be done in bold or semi-bold to make them stand out.
  - Body: will be regular, or even light depending on legibility.

Nunito: [Link to Google fonts Nunito page](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?query=nunito)
![screenshot of Nunito font example from Google fonts](README+/images/Nunito-font-screenshot.png)

The roundedness of Nunito makes it a slightly friendlier font to use on things that I want to differentiate and stand out some more.
  - It may be used in sub-headers or buttons as it's a bit more welcoming.

Font Sizes:
  - H1: 32-40px
  - H2: 28-32px
  - H3: 22-26px
  - Body Text: 16-18px

### colour/theme

The selected colours have been chosen with the subject matter of the website in mind; so chosen to evoke calmer responses, etc.

I will also endeavour to ensure that font-colours and their relevant background meet the accessibility standards for contrast.

This link will be used to check the colours meet the contrast ratios needed: [Colour Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

The current colour pallete for the website was created with [Color Mind](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/)

### Josh Comeau's updated CSS Reset
This is a standard template that can be used at the beginning of any project. Its purpose is to override some of the standard styling applied to elements that usually are overriden in the course of a project anyway.

You can find a link to this and its explanations here: [Josh Comeau's CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)

Perhaps the most important part is the box sizing part near the begining.


### CSS Pre-Compiler
SCSS (or SASS) was used to precompile the CSS. The pre-compiler allows CSS code to function more like a normal language; one can make use of variables, mathmatical functions, if statements, etc.
